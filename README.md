This is just a simple tool I made for myself, you can use it too!

Thanks to cydiaupdates.org for providing a source to download deb files.
Thanks to r/reddit for the google spreadsheet of compatible tweaks:)

PRs are always welcome!
If someone want to create an app for it, it will be the best. I don't have the time right now to do it.
