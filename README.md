ar

Thanks to cydiaupdates.org for providing a source to download deb files.
Thanks to r/reddit for the google spreadsheet of compatible tweaks:)

PRs are always welcome!
If someone want to create an app for it, it will be the best. I don't have the time right now to do it.

Added GPL-3.0 license to the project, you can use the code but must provide the source too.
Sharde the code, open source!
